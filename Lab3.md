### Part 0
I feel that with my project I would like to follow through with an idea in which I created an app
that can simulate a golf round for the user. While many apps keep track of courses, your handicap, and
other different pats of your game, very few actually show you which holes you struggle with the most,
which is what my app intends to do. I would most likely use a data base of golf courses, if one exists,
and it would be a phone app. The end goal is hopefully to create an app that will help you hone your skills even more.
